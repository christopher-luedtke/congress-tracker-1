# congress-tracker
I used Flask as the backend and React as the frontend. I used React Bootstrap to stylize things. I used flask_login to keep track of users and if they are logged in. The ProPublica API was used to get the data on the politicans one looks up. PostgresSQL was used as the backend.

This will be a project I rebuild in the future. It will be much more organized and planned out in advance. As bad as this project turned out, and it is an absolute disaster, it is also the most I have learned throughout the course. My revamp of this will be much more organized and well designed.
